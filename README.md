In the United States, there are many stores in which survey was conducted based on students i.e.how much they are spending on different kinds of purchases like Videogames, Indoor, Toys, Books, Gadgets etc. 

ðŸš€ Exciting Project: Retail Store Student Spending Analysis in Power BI ðŸŽ®ðŸ“Š

As part of a recent data analysis project, I worked on a comprehensive Power BI Report to analyze student spending patterns across various retail stores in the United States. The dataset focused on students' expenditures on items like video games, indoor/outdoor sports, toys, books, gadgets, and more.

Key Deliverables:

Tabular Visualization: Applied color formatting to the Total Amount of Purchase (TAP) based on store location and setting, helping stakeholders easily identify spending trends.
Matrix Visualization: Displayed spending on outdoor sports across different ages and store settings with conditional formatting for quick insights.
Funnel Chart: Showed the Total Amount of Purchase by store setting with percentage data labels for a clear understanding of sales distribution.
Pie Chart: Analyzed total purchases by store location for the Suburban setting, highlighting location-based buying behavior.
Scatter & Sand Dance Plots: Used advanced visualizations to reveal relationships between video game purchases and outdoor sports spending across different age groups.
Row-Level Security (RLS): Implemented data access restrictions for users, ensuring that individuals like Mani could only view data for Rural areas, enhancing data security and user-specific insights.
This project gave me the opportunity to apply Power BI's advanced visualization and security features while providing actionable insights for retail businesses. It was a great learning experience in understanding consumer behavior and data-driven decision-making. ðŸ’¡
