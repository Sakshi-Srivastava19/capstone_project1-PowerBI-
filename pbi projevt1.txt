
Project: In the United States, there are many stores in which a survey was
conducted based on students i.e. how much they are spending on different kinds
of purchases like Video games, Indoor games, Toys, Books, Gadgets etc. In the
data set (Student Survey), Store setting is the column that explains the Type of
location in which the store is present. By using a data set (Student Survey), try to
extract meaningful insights.
Industry Type: Retail Store
Data set: Student survey
Problem Statement: Create a Power BI Report
1. Tabular Visualization: Format the total amount of purchase (TAP) based
on ‘Store location’ and ‘Store setting’: -
● If 0<TAP<35000, then records should be in red color
● If 35000<=TAP<60000, then records should be in yellow color
● If TAP>=60000, then records should be in Blue color
2. Matrix Visualization: Create Matrix Visualization to show the amount
spent on Outdoor sports across different ages and ‘Store setting’. Do the
color formatting for the amount spent in total outdoor sports.
3. Funnel Chart: Create a Funnel chart to show Total amount of purchase by
‘Store setting’. Show the data labels as Percentage of First.
4. Pie Chart: Show the total amount of purchase by different ‘Store location’
for Suburban ‘Store setting’ only.
Hint: Use Filter context
5. a) Scatter plot - Video games purchase and Outdoor sports spent across
the different ages.
b) Sand dance plot - Indoor sports and Video games spent across the
different age groups.
6. Restrict data access for the given users in the User mapping table. For
example, Mani deals with Rural areas only so she should be able to view
the data which belongs to Rural only, not urban and suburban data.


ANSWERS

1. Tabular Visualization: Format the total amount of purchase (TAP) based on ‘Store location’ and ‘Store setting’
Objective: Color the records based on the value of Total Amount of Purchase (TAP).

Steps:

Import the Student Survey dataset into Power BI.
Create a Table Visualization using the fields: Store location, Store setting, and Total Amount of Purchase (TAP).
Add conditional formatting to the TAP column:
Click on the TAP column in the table.
Go to the Format pane, and select Conditional Formatting > Background Color.
Set rules for the colors:
For TAP < 35000, set the color to Red.
For 35000 <= TAP < 60000, set the color to Yellow.
For TAP >= 60000, set the color to Blue.

2. Matrix Visualization: Show the amount spent on Outdoor sports across different ages and ‘Store setting’
Objective: Create a matrix to show the amount spent on Outdoor sports across different ages and store settings, with color formatting for the amounts.

Steps:

Create a Matrix Visualization.
Add Age to the Rows, Store setting to the Columns, and Outdoor sports spent to the Values.
To add color formatting, follow similar steps to the previous task:
Click on the Outdoor sports spent field in the matrix.
Go to Conditional Formatting and choose to format the Font Color or Background Color based on values.
Set your color rules (e.g., red for lower amounts, blue for higher amounts, or custom rules based on your needs).
3. Funnel Chart: Total Amount of Purchase by ‘Store setting’
Objective: Create a funnel chart to show the total amount of purchase by store setting, with data labels as percentage of the first.

Steps:

Create a Funnel Chart.
Add Store setting to the Group field.
Add TAP (Total Amount of Purchase) to the Values field.
In the Format pane, turn on Data Labels.
Set the Data label value to show the percentage of the first.
4. Pie Chart: Total amount of purchase by different ‘Store location’ for Suburban ‘Store setting’ only
Objective: Create a pie chart to show the total amount of purchase for different store locations in suburban store settings only.

Steps:

Create a Pie Chart visualization.
Add Store location to the Legend field and TAP (Total Amount of Purchase) to the Values field.
Apply a Filter on the Store setting column to only show the data for Suburban.
Adjust the Data Labels as necessary to show the values in the pie chart.
5. a) Scatter plot - Video games purchase and Outdoor sports spent across the different ages
Objective: Create a scatter plot to show the relationship between video game purchases and outdoor sports spending across different age groups.

Steps:

Create a Scatter Plot visualization.
Add Age to the Axis field.
Add Video games purchase to the X-Axis and Outdoor sports spent to the Y-Axis.
This scatter plot will show how these two amounts vary across different ages.
5. b) Sand dance plot - Indoor sports and Video games spent across the different age groups
Objective: Create a sand dance plot (also known as a stacked area chart) to show the spending on Indoor sports and Video games across different age groups.

Steps:

Create a Stacked Area Chart visualization.
Add Age to the Axis field.
Add Indoor sports spent and Video games spent to the Values field.
This chart will show how the spending in both categories evolves across different age groups.
6. Restrict Data Access for Specific Users (User Mapping Table)
Objective: Set row-level security (RLS) to restrict data access based on user roles.

Steps:

In Power BI Desktop, go to Modeling > Manage Roles.
Create a new role, such as RuralAccess.
For the role, apply a DAX filter on the Store setting column to filter only Rural data. For example:
[Store setting] = "Rural"
Publish the report to Power BI Service and assign the role to the appropriate user, e.g., Mani.
In the Power BI Service, go to Security for the dataset and assign the role to Mani, ensuring that she will only see the Rural data.
